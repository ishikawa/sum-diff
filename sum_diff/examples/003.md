# await act(async () => ...)

I hacked together an asynchronous version of `act(...)`, and it's kinda nice.

You've seen the synchronous version:

```javascript
act(() => {
  // updates and stuff
});
// make assertions
```

This still works, and gives the same warnings. But if you pass an async function:

```javascript
await act(async () => {
  // updates and stuff
});
// expect commits and effects to be flushed
// make assertions
```

Neat! I set it up so if you *don't* `await` the result from `act`, a warning gets triggered (with `setImmediate`) to do so. That makes it a bit harder to have rogue async `act()` calls in the ether.

You can nest `act()` calls:

```javascript
await act(async () => {
  // nest synchronous calls
  act(() => {
    // updates and such
  });
  // as before, updates and effects are flushed

  // make assertions
  await sleep(500); // or for a promise to resolve, or whatever
  // more assertions maybe

  // nest asynchronous calls too
  await act(async () => {
    // mutations and such
    // more awaits
    // and maybe an event or two
  });
  // more assertions
});
```

I implemented a cheap form of unrolling safety, so if a previous `act()` gets closed before any subsequent `act()` calls, a warning gets triggered. This should prevent most interleaving attempts, and maintain a tree-like shape of `act()` blocks.

**pros**

- works with async/await, solves oss problems cleanly
- the sync api is preserved
- the warning is preserved
- works with fake timers/fb

**cons**

- can't guarantee batching after the first await in an act block (this will get better when concurrent?)
- less restrictive than the sync model, and starts to feel more opt-in than opt-out (eg- someone could just wrap their entire test with an `act()` call... which might be fine?)
- exposes a secret api on react dom to implement it, dunno how you feel about that
