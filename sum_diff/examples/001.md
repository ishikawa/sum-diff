# Add `UserAuthentication` class to improve login process (#123)

This PR introduces a new `UserAuthentication` class to enhance the login process and improve overall
security.

Key changes:

- Create `UserAuthentication` class in `auth/user_authentication.rb`
- Implement password hashing using `bcrypt` gem
- Update `User` model to utilize the new authentication class

The `UserAuthentication` class encapsulates the login logic and password management, separating
these concerns from the `User` model. This change improves code organization and makes it easier to
maintain and extend authentication functionality in the future.

Example usage of the new class:

```ruby
user_auth = UserAuthentication.new(user)
if user_auth.authenticate(password)
  # Proceed with login
else
  # Handle authentication failure
end
```

This new implementation ensures that passwords are securely hashed and compared, reducing the risk of password-related vulnerabilities.
